# Modular-1
I always liked the concept of the Nord Modular (never used one though) so i decided to give it a try. Here we are

## Webapp

There's a Webappp here: https://wiggismodular.github.io/Modular-1/ that allows you to make patches, like you would do on a modular system and upload it to the FM-1

Modules have two parameter inputs: p1 and p2 with an attenuverter

Then there's a matrix for to map p1 and p2 as well as k1-4 to some parameter of the module. p1 and p2 are global. k1-4 only when you're on that module (see later) 

## FM-1

In addition to the modular synth engine, there's also some complex arpeggiator. 

Knobs and stuff.

* **PRESETS** scrolls trough the patches 
* **SELECT** scrolls trough the modules in the patch
* **KNOB1 - 4** do what's described
* **ARP** opens the arpeggiator's melody page (mode, scale, root note, speed)
* **SEQ** opens the arpeggiator's rhythm page (euclid steps, pulses, rotation, rate)
* **LFO** opens arpeggiator's chaos page, adds some randomness and lets select how many octaves the arpeggio spans.
* **HOME** opens the main page of the patch

## Hack it

- Run it yourself: `cd web && npm install && npm run dev`
- Build the firmware: `nix develop`, then `python3 tools/build.py`
